# odin-etch-a-sketch
This project idea was to implement a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch but the main goal was to "flex" my DOM manipulation skills and most of all to frequently Google to get the right JavaScript methods and CSS to use.
Also, this was my first encounter with a race condition without even realizing it!... But that probably won't be the last after what I've learned.
